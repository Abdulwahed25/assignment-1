# How My Website Works

This file explains the basics of how I built my portfolio project.

### The Files

I used three main files for my website:
* **`index.html`**: This file has all the main content and text.
* **`css/styles.css`**: This file has all the code for the colors, fonts, and layout.
* **`js/script.js`**: This file has the code that makes the website interactive.

### How the HTML is Built

I used different sections for the header (top part), the main content, and the footer (bottom part). Each part of the page, like "About Me" and "Projects," is in its own `<section>` box. This helps keep the code organized.

### How the CSS Works

My CSS code does two main things:
1.  It centers the main content in the middle of the page.
2.  It creates a "dark mode." I made a special class in my CSS called `.dark-mode`. When JavaScript adds this class to the page, all the colors change to the dark theme.

### How the JavaScript Works

My JavaScript file does four main things:
1.  **Welcome Message**: Shows a "Welcome" pop-up when you first open the site.
2.  **Greeting**: Checks the time on your computer to say "Good Morning" or "Good Afternoon."
3.  **Theme Change**: When you click the "Change Theme" button, the script adds or removes the `.dark-mode` class from the whole page.
4.  **Contact Form**: When you click "Send Message," it stops the page from reloading and shows a "Thank You" pop-up.
