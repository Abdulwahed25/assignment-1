# My AI Report for Assignment 1

### What AI Tools I Used

I used Google Gemini and ChatGPT to help me with this assignment.

### How I Used AI

* To get ideas for my website, like for the "About Me" and "Projects" sections.
* To help write some of the JavaScript and CSS code.
* To create the pictures for my project section.

### A Challenge I Faced

I had a big problem when I tried to push my code to GitHub. I kept getting an error. I used ChatGPT, and it gave me some commands to type in the terminal. After trying a few commands, I was able to fix the problem and upload my work.

### What I Learned

The AI was really helpful for finding bugs. It showed me small mistakes I made, which will help me in the future. I learned that AI is a good tool.
